After learning javascript.info decided to continue my learning with mentor. The choice
fell on Ivan, bought over by his approach to mentoring, ability to give knowledge from
the very fundamentals to that modern techniques. He builts learning program well, tailoring
it to your goals and talents.

During the month of training I managed to learn React basics and create my first realistic
application, and try out my skills at Backend (builing a simple CRUD Koa app). I also feel like
I'm significantly raised my programming and JavaScript competence after a few interview trainings
(or were they lectures? ;). That last part, I think, was the most useful for me.

Ivan is very attentive to details, makes great code reviews (I have experience to compare). In
any topic of interest, he can immerse you to the depth you're still able to understand but couldn't
get there on your own. I will surely continue my learning with him.
